                    Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.

                <div className='program-ans'>
                    <p>
                    Programming languages use classes and functions that control commands. The reason that programming is so important is that it directs a computer to complete these commands over and over again, so people do not have to do the task repeatedly. Instead, the software can do it automatically and accurately.

                    A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task.

            <h2 >Types of programming language</h2>
            <h3 >1. Low-level programming language</h3>
                 <p>Low-level language is <strong>machine-dependent (0s and 1s)</strong> programming language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run very fast.</p>
                     <p>Low-level language is further divided into two parts -</p>
                        <p><strong>i. Machine Language</strong></p>
                            <p>Machine language is a type of low-level programming language. It is also called as <strong>machine code or object code</strong>. Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary or hexadecimal form (base 16) form. It does not require a translator to convert the programs because computers directly understand the machine language programs.</p>

                        <p><strong>ii. Assembly Language</strong></p>
                            <p>Assembly language  is also a type of low-level programming language that is designed for specific processors. It represents the set of instructions in a <strong>symbolic and human-understandable form</strong>. It uses an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.</p>

            <h3 >2. High-level programming language</h3>
                <p>High-level programming language  is designed for <strong>developing user-friendly software programs and websites</strong>. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language .</p>
          
            <p>High-level programming language includes <strong>Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language</strong>.</p>
            <p>A high-level language is further divided into three parts -</p>
                <p><strong>i. Procedural Oriented programming language</strong></p>
                    <p>Procedural Oriented Programming language is derived from structured programming and based upon the procedure call concept. It divides a program into small procedures called <strong>routines or functions</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Procedural Oriented programming language is used by a software programmer to create a program that can be accomplished by using a programming editor like IDE, Adobe Dreamweaver, or Microsoft Visual Studio.</p>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> C, FORTRAN, Basic, Pascal, etc.</p>
                <p><strong>ii. Object-Oriented Programming language</strong></p>
                    <p>Object-Oriented Programming language is <strong>based upon the objects</strong>. In this <strong>programming language, programs are divided into small parts called objects</strong>. It is used to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc in the program to makes the program resusable, efficient, and easy-to-use.</p>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.</p>
                <p><strong>iii. Natural language</strong></p>
                    <p>Natural language is a <strong>part of human languages</strong> such as English, Russian, German, and Japanese. It is used by machines to understand, manipulate, and interpret human's language. It is used by developers to <strong>perform tasks such as translation, automatic summarization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), relationship extraction, and topic segmentation</strong>.</p>

            <h3 >3. Middle-level programming language</h3>
                <p>Middle-level programming language <strong>lies between the low-level programming language and high-level programming language</strong>. It is also known as the intermediate programming language and pseudo-language.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> C, C++, language</p>
